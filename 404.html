  <h1>404: Page not found :(</h1>

  <p>Sorry, but the page you were trying to view does not exist.</p>

<p>It looks like this was the result of either:</p>

<ul>
<li>a mistyped address</li>
<li>an out-of-date link</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Latest Posting:</h2>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts limit:1 %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>
        <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
