jekyll-site
===========

This is a port of my wordpress blog that has been moved to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) via the [Jekyll Imports](http://import.jekyllrb.com/) plugin. At some time in the future, this will be integrated with Jenkins.

Feel free to check out my development site: [jenntes.no-ip.org](http://jenntes.no-ip.org/)

1. Download/clone this archive and unzip.
2. Run jekyll serve

9. Go through postings, and make sure all formatting is similar and proepr - have only code tags instead of pre.
10. Run through google  page speed and yslow
11. Compare against the [Web Accessibility Checklist](http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html)
