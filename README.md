jekyll-site
===========

This is a port of my wordpress blog that has been moved to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) via the [Jekyll Imports](http://import.jekyllrb.com/) plugin.

Feel free to check out my development site: [http://jenntes-jekyll.azurewebsites.net/](http://jenntes-jekyll.azurewebsites.net/) or [jenntes.no-ip.org](http://jenntes.no-ip.org/).

Once completed, the production url will be: [http://jenntesolin.com/](jenntesolin.com).
