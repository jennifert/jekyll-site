## Check out my gists
There are a bunch of gists I have created that are not yet documented in my blog. The latest one is [NPM build scripts](https://gist.github.com/jennifert/3ca4225cf7876e560eb1cd9e91994b97), which replaces Grunt build scripts. The current one is written for mac, but will also write one up for windows and link here when completed.
