jekyll-site
===========

This is a port of my wordpress blog that has been moved to [Jekylll](http://jekyllrb.com/) via the [Jekyll Imports](http://import.jekyllrb.com/) plugin and is the development repository.

The production URL is the same as before: [http://jenntesolin.com/](jenntesolin.com).

## How-to install

[Check out my documentation](https://www.jenntesolin.com/blog/2015/03/17/Jekyll-Set-Up-Publish/). It has been moved to my website and expanded on.
