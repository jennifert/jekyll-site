<p>Recently I was wrestling with an issue with a time picker plugin not firing my custom validator onChange event. Here's the problem and how it was resolved.<!--more-->Our timepicker custom validation was not firing the onChange event. The following post from Stack overflow solved my problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8649565/do-not-fire-custom-validate-on-onchange-event-of-a-textbox" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8649565/do-not-fire-custom-validate-on-onchange-event-of-a-textbox</a></p>
<p>The problem was that for some reason it did not like control to validate. As suggested by the above post, using a validation group in my custom validation solved the issue.</p>
