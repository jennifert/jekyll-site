<p>One project I worked on had a table with different spellings  between English and French between an individual's title (masculine vs feminine in French). Since I did not want to spend too much time programming in the application itself, I came across the mysql 'case' function during research.<!--more-->:</p>
<p>mySQL case is like a switch statement. Check out the official <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/case.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Manual Reference</a> for a more through explanation.</p>
<pre><code>Case When
    table1.Gender = 'Female'
Then
  table1.titlef
When
  table1.Gender = 'Male'
Then
  table1.titlem
End AS titlefr</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps someone else!</p>
