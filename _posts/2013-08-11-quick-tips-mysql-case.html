<p>There was a table that had different spellings for titles in between male and female titles. However, I did not want to spend too much time programming in the application itself. I stumbled upon the mysql case<!--more-->:</p>
<pre>Case When table1.Gender = 'Female' Then table1.ftitlesfr When table1.Gender = 'Male' Then table1.mtitlesfr End AS titlesfr</pre>
<p>You the above in place of a field name as such:.</p>
<pre>SELECT table1.name, table1, table1.titleen, Case When table1.Gender = 'Female' Then table1.ftitlesfr When table1.Gender = 'Male' Then table1.mtitlesfr End AS titlesfr FROM table1</pre>
<p>Â Hope this helps someone else!</p>
