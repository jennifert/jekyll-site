<p>While working on a project, I was looking for a way to join to mysql columns without using php or .net. I came across the concat function. It basically allows you to join together 2 columns as one.</p>

<p>Here is the code:</p>
<p>
<pre>
SELECT CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname) As fullname FROM table1 ....
</pre></p>
<p>Hope it helps someone.</p>
