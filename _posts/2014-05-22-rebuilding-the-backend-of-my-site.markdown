So I am currently in the process of moving my WordPress blog over to using the Jekyll system. I will be trying to move it over before my hosting renews - this way I can try my hosting up at github pages or windows azure.<!--more-->

If anyone is interested, I have some preview links below:

[Development Site]:  (http://jenntes.no-ip.org/)
[https://github.com/jennifert/jekyll-site]:    Github Repo

Eventually, there will be a series of posts of my experience. Feel free to comment on your own experience using the system.
