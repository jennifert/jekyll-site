<p>
	This post describes how to install git and github on your mac installation. There are two common ways to install. Both methods are described below. Please note the first way requires homebrew. <!--more-->
</p>

<h2>Installing with homebrew</h2>

<p>
	To install GIT, just run the below commands and enter your information when requested. Brew update/upgrade is being run to show best practice. Files should always be updated before trying to run commands.
</p>

<pre><code>brew update<br>brew upgrade<br>brew install git<br>brew install git-gui</code></pre>

<p>Or if you use Github, you first install the github cask by running the below command into your terminal. Once installed, click "Install command line tool" from the menu.</p>

<pre><code>brew install --cask github</code></pre>

<h2>Installing with DMG files</h2>

<p>Download the DMG file from the <a hrf="https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Official Binary installer from Sourceforge</a>.</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, if you use github, you can download the <a hrf="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">github desktop DMG</a> file, then install the git command line tools from the app itself.
</p>

<p>
	To install the git command line tools from within the GitHub application, click on the app name "GitHub Desktop", then choose "Install command line tool".
