jekyll-site
===========

This is a port of my wordpress blog that has been moved to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) via the [Jekyll Imports](http://import.jekyllrb.com/) plugin. At some time in the future, this will be integrated with Jenkins.

Feel free to check out my development site: [jenntes.no-ip.org](http://jenntes.no-ip.org/)

###Install steps:

1. Download/clone this archive and unzip.
2. Run jekyll serve
3. Browse to: http://localhost:4000

###Upcoming updates:

In no particular order:

- fix styles for: footer bar, header bar and code tags.
- More customization such as blog file attachments to use the config and be generated by system.
- Move source code to gists - similar to [this](https://workshop.avatarnewyork.com/post/jekyll-gist-tag/)
- Fill in content on the about page.

###Blog to do:
