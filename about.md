Hello my name is Jennifer Tesolin, and I have been a professional web developer since 2006 (and as a hobbyist since since 2000). Some web technologies I have worked with include PHP, ASP.net, JavaScript, Wordpress, Digital Ocean, MERN stack, and HTML emails. Currently, I am learning Mern Stack, Python, CSS3 & SASS, as well as HTML5 technologies.

Other hobbies I enjoy are traveling, visiting with family and friends, watching Anime, and tinkering with my Raspberry Pi computer.

Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:jtesolin@gmail.com) if there is any content you want to see, or any issues to fix.
