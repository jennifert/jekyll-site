Hello my name is Jennifer Tesolin, and I am a web developer based in Toronto (Canada) with over 7 years of experience in various web technologies. Some technologies I am currently learning are: mobile app development (for both android and ios), css pre-precessors, html 5 + css 3, and the lastest php and net versions.

Currently, a lot of the projects will involve: php or asp.net, with jquery and bootstrap. My github repos at the time of writing are mostly PHP and bootstrap demos.

Other hobbies I enjoy are travelling, visiting with family and friends, watching Anime, and tinkering with my Raspberry Pi coumputer. My Flickr account has pictures taken in my travels around the globe. Please check them out and make any comments.

###Upcoming posts

Some upcoming tutorials (in no particular order) are:

* jekyll set-up and publishing
* jenkins with github
* making a bootstrap carousel that pull simages from the Flickr API
* php development on IIS
