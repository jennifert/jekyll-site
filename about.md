Hello my name is Jennifer Tesolin, and I have been a professional web developer since 2006 (and as a hobbyist since since 2000). Some web technologies I have worked with include PHP, ASP.net, JavaScript/jQuery, Wordpress, basic server admin, and HTML emails. Currently, I am learning ASP.net 5 MVC & Web API, CSS3 & SASS, as well as HTML5 technologies.

Other hobbies I enjoy are traveling, visiting with family and friends, watching Anime, and tinkering with my Raspberry Pi computer. My Flickr account has pictures taken in my travels around the globe and comic cons. Please check them out and make any comments.

### Upcoming content

Some upcoming tutorials (in no particular order) are:

* Creating a development environment on the Mac: a video and blog series. The posts are currently being written out and screen captured (will release a rough version first, so stay tuned). This will focus on Mac Sierra version of the operating system.

Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/jennifert/jekyll-site/issues) if there is any content you want to see.

### What I am listening to

Here are some Spotify playlists from my account. They are more event driven than mood based.

		<p><b>Coding music:</b><br>
		While coding or doing any type of work on the computer, I love music with a geat beat and limited vocals. Here is what is currently on my list:</p>

		<p><b>Commuting music:</b><br>
		While on my commute to work, or just walking around the city, I typically listen to various Soundtracks/Scores. Here is a playlist containing my favourite songs (with vocals) from the RWBY anime.</p>
