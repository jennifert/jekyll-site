Hello my name is Jennifer Tesolin, and I have been a professional web developer since 2006 (and as a hobbyist since since 2000). Some web technologies I have worked with include PHP, ASP.net, JavaScript, Wordpress, Digital Ocean, Node, React, and HTML emails.

Feel free to [send me an email](mailto:me@jenntesolin.com) if there is any content you want to see, or any issues to fix.
