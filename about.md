Hello my name is Jennifer Tesolin, and I am a web developer based in Toronto (Canada) with over 8 years of experience in various web technologies.

Some technologies I am currently learning are: mobile app development (for both android and iOS), css pre-processors, html 5 + css 3, and the latest Php and .Net versions.

Currently, my projects are in Php, JavaScript, and Asp.net. My Github Repositories at the time of writing are mostly PHP and bootstrap demos.

Other hobbies I enjoy are traveling, visiting with family and friends, watching Anime, and tinkering with my Raspberry Pi computer. My Flickr account has pictures taken in my travels around the globe. Please check them out and make any comments.

###Upcoming posts

Some upcoming tutorials (in no particular order) are:

* Jekyll set-up and publishing
* Jenkins with Github
* Php development on IIS
