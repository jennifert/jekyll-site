Hello my name is Jennifer Tesolin, and I have been a professional web developer since 2006 (and as a hobbyist since since 2000). Some web technologies I have worked with include PHP, ASP.net, JavaScript, Wordpress, Digital Ocean, Node, React, and HTML emails.

Feel free to use Github issues if there is any content you want to see, or any issues to fix.
